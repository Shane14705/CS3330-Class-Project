# CS3330-Class-Project
## Instructions for using this repository
1. Decide what you want to work on (ie: a specific class, database features, the main loop, etc)

2. Create a separate branch to work on that piece of the project separately from anything else (if you need new features on the main branch, you can merge the main branch with your personal project branch to get the updates)

3. Once you have finished the work which you intended to do with a given branch, submit a pull request to merge that branch back into the main branch. This will allow us to see all of the places where it may conflict with existing code before we decide to merge it.

4. Pick out another part to work on, make a new branch for it, rinse and repeat. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on discord (Shane1470#1936) or on the canvas discussion.

## Git Tips
- Try to only work on one thing at a time. This will keep the amount of conflicts low. Ideally, whatever you choose to work on for your branch should not require any new code to be added to classes outside of the one that your branch is working on (ie: it should only add code to the base, not change existing code).
- If you do have to change existing code outside of what your branch is working on, try to keep the changes as small as possible. That way, when you do your pull request we will easily be able to see the portions you changed and decide whether or not that will break other people's code.
